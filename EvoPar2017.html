		<h3>A performance assessment of evolutionary
		algorithms in volunteer computing
		environments:</h3>
		<h1>the importance of entropy</h1>
		
		<h3>Merelo, de las Cuevas, García-Sánchez,
		  García-Valdez</h3>

		<aside class='notes'>This is an example of <a
		  href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drip_painting'>Drip
		  Painting</a> by a completely unknown author. In this
		  type of painting structure and, if you will, beauty,
		  emerges from the fractal nature of the dripping and
		  how it distributes itself, apparently randomly, over
		  the canvas. The technique, besides, allows people
		  with not too much experience to contribute to
		  art. In a volunteer way, maybe, such as the
		  volunteer computer system we are working with.

		The <a
	      href='http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v399/n6735/full/399422a0.html'>fractal
		  analysis of Pollock drip painting</a> is old, but
	      has been sufficiently proved and, in fact, the
	      dimensions increased during his career. </aside>

		<aside class='notes'><a
		  href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Steir'>Pat
	      Steir</a> is an artist that uses often this drip
	      painting technique, introducing chance in her painting
		  and giving them this <em>natural</em> look, as in
	      the case of these Sixteen waterfalls. How structure
	      emerges in the lower reaches of the canvas via this
	      waterfall technique, by mixing one waterfall with
	      another, reminds us how the power of this painting is
	      not simple aggregation, but the mixing and interaction
		  with whatever was on the canvas before that. In
		  fact, the <a href='https://www.google.es/search?client=ubuntu&channel=fs&q=chinese+character+for+evolution&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&gfe_rd=cr&ei=Q1z0WPaWIczI8gequamQBw#safe=off&channel=fs&q=evolution+in+chinese'>Chinese word for evolution</a>a> is the same word as
	      for flow, as in a river, as in dripping. It's endless
	      change, and in this paper we will see that evolution is
	      helped by this creation of complexity, not only by
	      aggregation.</aside>

		  <h1>Time-to-solution vs. entropy</h1>
		  <img src='EvoPar2017/figure/entropy-1.png' style='width:900px'
		       alt='Performance and entropy'>

		  <aside class='notes'>We are using
		<em>compression</em> entropy here, that is,
		compressing the string and measuring the
		ratio. Ratios close to 1 mean that strings do not have
		repeated patterns, while lower ones mean exactly the
		opposite. Clearly time decreases with entropy, not
		with the number or PUTs or the number of different
		IPs, although obviously more IPs will contribute to a
		higher IP if they contribute in a different way. </aside>
