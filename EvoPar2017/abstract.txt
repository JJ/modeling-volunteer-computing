A performance assessment of evolutionary algorithms in volunteer computing environments: the importance of entropy

In a volunteer distributed computing system, users run a program on
their own machine to contribute to a common effort. If the program is
embedded in a web page, collaboration is straightforward, but also
ephemeral. In this paper, we analyze a volunteer evolutionary
computing system called NodIO, by running several experiments, some of
them massive. Our objective is to discover rules that encourage
volunteer participation and also the interplay of these contributions
with the dynamics of the algorithm itself, making it efficient enough.
We will show different measures of participation and contribution to
the algorithm, as well as how different volunteer usage patterns and
tweaks in the algorithm, such as restarting clients when a solution
has been found, contribute to improvements and leveraging of these
contributions. We will also try to find out what is the key factor in
the early termination of the experiments, measuring entropy in the
contributions and other large scale indicators.
