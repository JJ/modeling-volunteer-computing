	      <section data-background='https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8609/16062218322_3215a816db_k_d.jpg' title='Grid, with bird'>
		<aside class='notes'>Most people developing distributed evolutionary
		algorithms think that the computing world is a little bit
		like that. Except the cat, that is. Regular,
		identical, static, always the same. Nothing changes
		and you can do stuff like parallel evolutionary
		algorithm of GPGPU or cluster computing or
		  grid. Pretty straighforward, synchronous,
		predictable.</aside>
	      </section>
	      
	      <section data-background='https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5533/10905624385_ce43ee8269_k_d.jpg' title='cobweb, with morning droplets'>
		<aside class='notes'>Of course, it's bit more like
		this. Nodes have different sizes, they are distributed
		unevenly and have different number of connections, and
		are as fragile as this spiderweb. It's also as
		numerous as the junctions or as the droplets in it,
		much more massive. And maybe you could take advantage
		  of it.</aside>
	      </section>

	      <section data-background='https://farm1.staticflickr.com/2/2172614_c1a030fd7c_b_d.jpg' title='all kind of grains'>
		<aside class='notes'>First, we have to realize what's
	      the nature of this new world. It's no longer fine grain or
	      coarse grain or whatever. There are all kinds of grains,
	      but in particular we have three different types of
	      technologies that we might want to address: peer to
	      peer, cloud computing and cycle scavenging/volunteer
		  computing.</aside>
	      </section>

	      <section data-background='img/clouds.jpg' alt='clouds from a
	      plane, picture by me'>
		<aside class='notes'>The clouds exemplify very well
		what goes on in this new computing environment. First,
		because a part of it is literally called
		cloud. Second, because they are out there and there
		are lots of them, but they are predictable only in the
		short term and also ephemeral, here this moment, gone
		  the next. </aside>
	      </section>

	      <section data-background='img/tap.jpg' alt='flowing
		tap'>
		<aside class='notes'>That's another characteristic of
		this new environment: it's available on tap. You pay
		cloud computing resources, CPU, storage, other more
		advanced applications like Map/Reduce, by the hour or
		minute. This means two things: you can have as much as
		you want, and second, this comes at a  cost. Your
		algorithms will have to be scale and cost conscious,
		because you might be eventually wasting your grant
		  just on computing resources.</aside>
	      </section>

	      <section data-background='img/clocks.jpg' alt='Bombay
		clocks by  mybigtrip' >

		<aside class='notes'>In many cases, asynchrony is also
		the norm. First, because you can't expect virtual
		machines to start at exactly the same time or behave
		in exactly the same way, and they're spending while
		they are running. Second, because in the case of
		volunteer systems they might simply not be
		available. Even distributed computing can't work in
		lockstep, and there must be some way of permanently
		storing the algorithm state (or part of it) so that it
		  can resume when resources are available.</aside>
	      </section>

	      <section
	      data-background='https://farm4.staticflickr.com/3160/2327155978_31004d2ab2_b_d.jpg'
	      alt='free beer'>
		<aside class='notes'>The good thing is that you can
	      gather a incredible amount of resources for free or a
	      low price. A full month of a server running in Azure or
	      Amazon can be a few dollars, a little bit more than a
	      hosting. You can do a lot of things with the free tier
	      of Platform as a Service or Infrastructure as a
	      service. And, finally, if you go for volunteer computing
	      the amount of resources can be unlimited in terms of
		  computing nodes, although very limited in terms of time</aside>
	      </section>

	      <section
		data-background='https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7279/7408451314_e4f6f403a9_k_d.jpg'
		title='assembly line'>

		<aside class='notes'>You
		  can obtain computing power aplenty this way, but it comes at a cost: you have to change the
		  methodology for developing software. Team/test/agile
		  based using infrastructure-as-code/build/deployment
		  tools. It's a small cost, since it makes your science,
		  eventually, better and more reprodutible.</aside>

		alt='volunteers'>
		<aside class='notes'>Volunteer computing is no longer
		a simple entertainment. It graduated wit SETI@home and
		there are several patents that cover its use in
		browsers. And there are browsers everywhere. And, what
		is more importante, you can achieve a certain amount
		of computation without paying any money, although it's
		  not going to be free.</aside>
	      </section>

	      <section data-background='img/log-log-ips-experiment.png'>
		<aside class='notes'>This is what you can obtain in an
		  experiment a Sunday morning (and afternoon). Several
		  hundreds of different volunteers, and even more so,
		  some of then lending hundreds of thousands of
		  generations to the experiment.</aside>
