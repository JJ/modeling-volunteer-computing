\begin{quote}\textbf{
Please, correct the information about i7-4770 processor. Additionally, I would recommend to precise the concept of safety to "user's safety" (or "voluteer's safety") in the characteristic of the framework (page 5), as you still do not address the safety of the system as a whole, at least not at this point.

I would also recommend to include at least a short information that the system utilizes HTML5 Web Workers, as from my point of view it is one of the most important aspects of the framework and to reorganize the subsections in section IV and V. 

I would also change the title of the subsection V.A as it begins with ''F15:..'' which is a little bit confusing.
