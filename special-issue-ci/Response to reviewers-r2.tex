\begin{quote}\textbf{
Please, correct the information about i7-4770 processor. Additionally, I would recommend to precise the concept of safety to "user's safety" (or "voluteer's safety") in the characteristic of the framework (page 5), as you still do not address the safety of the system as a whole, at least not at this point.

I would also recommend to include at least a short information that the system utilizes HTML5 Web Workers, as from my point of view it is one of the most important aspects of the framework and to reorganize the subsections in section IV and V. 

I would also change the title of the subsection V.A as it begins with ''F15:..'' which is a little bit confusing.

1.- The section discussing the threats to validity of the experiments merely discuss the security issues of the platform but not the threats to the validity of the own experimentation performed in the paper. I strongly recommend to authors to follow the recommendations and guidelines described in [1] to address such comment.

2.- The figures 3,4 and 5 of the paper have not been modified according to our original comments: “Figures should be readable even in gray-scale, so do not use red and blue to denote different elements, use a different shade or texture. Additionally, the axis labels and legends in most of the figures are unreadable, please increase its font size.” I strongly recommend the authors to modify the figures to improve readability.
