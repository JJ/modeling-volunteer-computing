% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}

  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/epslatex/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.

% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/dblfloatfix/




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and 
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with 
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/endfloat/
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a 
% page by themselves.

\begin{abstract}
Volunteer computing is used routinely in science and enterprise but it
still has a long way to go if it is going to become mainstream in the
same way the cloud in general has. The lack of general purpose tools
with analytics built in could be one of the reasons why this is so, as
well ad the lack of proofs of concept. That is why in this paper we
present NodIO, a client-server architecture for distributed
evolutionary algorithms, written entirely in JavaScript, which needs
minimal server support to work and is able to support persistent,
asynchronous, distributed evolutionary algorithms running in the
browser. The architecture, along with some initial results on the expected performance and scaling
behaviour is presented. We also use the algorithm analytics to try and
create a model of user behavior which, as is usual in this kind of
computing models, follow a Weibull distribution.

\section{State of the art}
\label{sec:soa}

The web used as a resource for distributed computing has a
long history, and almost since the beginning it was used for 
evolutionary computation even before JavaScript was
introduced as a browser-based scripting language in 1997. Before that
time other procedures, including Flash animations and VBScript, ActiveX or Java applets were
used; for instance, Java was pointed out in \cite{soares1998get} as a ``language for
internet'', providing some advantages such as multi-architecture compatibility or 
security mechanisms and proposed in \cite{chandy1996world} as the
basis for the creation of a world-wide peer to peer system using Java
compiled programs. 

Using any of these languages allowed the creation
of client-server applications in the browser, provided the user had
installed the virtual machine plugin in it, but with the advantage of
providing a single and universal way of accessing resources via an
URI, something that is not guaranteed using desktop applications. However, this style of
computing presents several issues and challenges which were addressed
as early as 1996 by Baratloo et al. in their system Charlotte:
\cite{baratloo1996charlott}. This system, which implemented a
distributed shared memory, was inspired by previous work
on parallel computing systems PVM and MPI, but solved most issues by
using the Java virtual machine embedded in browser, which provides
security to the user, uniformity of computing environment
independently of the operating system and  access to a common data store in the
server. Other issues such as scheduling are solved on the server. This
paper was later extended and published in a journal in 1999
\cite{baratloo1999charlotte}, but it is interesting to note that
already in the early stages of the web the possibility of
browser-based distributed computing was already researched. 

One of the first papers by Soares et al. used Java, and in their paper \cite{soares1998get} they
describe JET, a system that supports 
the execution of parallel applications over the Internet. This system has 
a comprehensive statistics support, allowing its use for science,
since it allows the collection of algorithm analytics by the
experiment designer, unlike the other systems compared in that paper.

However, Java (and all the other technologies)
is not universal in the
sense than an extra component, namely, the Java virtual machine, has
to be installed in the browser. JavaScript
\cite{flanagan2006javascript} was introduced in 1997 as a
browser-embedded language and has, since then, become a set of standards
\cite{ECMA-262} for the language, its components and future versions
that have been widely adopted by the industry and also by scientists,
who used them for creating a non-distributed EA on
the browser as early as 1998 \cite{jj-ppsn98}. 

The potential for volunteer computing using browsers was realized
later on \cite{sarmenta-bayanihan} as well as the potential for
mischief of users with code in their hands
\cite{sarmenta-sabotagetolerance}. However, these early efforts by
Sarmenta once again used Java and not JavaScript, making this effort
less universal. JavaScript can be used either for unwitting
\cite{unwitting-ec} or volunteer
\cite{langdon:2005:metas,gecco07:workshop:dcor} distributed
evolutionary computation and it has been used ever since by several
authors, including more recent efforts \cite{Desell:2008:AHG:1389095.1389273,duda2013distributed,DBLP:journals/corr/abs-0801-1210} that even
used the client's GPU \cite{duda2013gpu}. Many other researchers have
used Java \cite{chong:1999:jDGPi} and others have gone away from the
server-based paradigm to embrace peer to peer systems
\cite{jin2006constructing,10.1109/ICICSE.2008.99}. These computing
platforms avoid single points of failure (the server) but, since they
need a certain amount of infrastructure installed to start, the
threshold to join them is much lower. 

There have been relatively few efforts to analyze what is the
performance that can be obtained from these volunteer computing
effort. There was some attempt initially to dodge the issue by making
the algorithm adaptive to the kind of resources allotted to it
\cite{milani2004online}, which is actually not such a big problem in
algorithms such as the EA that can easily be
parallelized via population splitting or farming out evaluations to all
the nodes available. Lately, several approaches have focused on the
fault-tolerance of volunteer algorithms
\cite{gonzalez2010characterizing} which can, of course, be studied in
a more general distributed computing context
\cite{nogueras2015studying} or including it in a more general study of
performance of the EA itself %Con tu permiso lo paso a acrÃ³nimos para
                             %que no sea tan largo el pÃ¡rrafo. FERGU
%OK - JJ
\cite{DBLP:journals/gpem/LaredoBGVAGF14}. But the raw material of
volunteer computing, number of users and the time spent in the
computation in browser-based volunteer computing experiments, have only been studied in a limited way in
\cite{DBLP:journals/gpem/LaredoBGVAGF14} on the basis of a single
run. Studies using volunteer computing platforms such as SETI@home
\cite{javadi2009mining} found out that the Weibull, log-normal and Gamma distribution
modeled quite well the availability of resources in several clusters
of that framework; the shape of those distributions is a skewed bell
with more resources in the {\em low} areas than in the high areas:
there are many users that give a small amount of cycles, while there
are just a few that give many cycles. This is in concordance with the
results obtained in \cite{agajaj}.

As far as we know, this paper presents the only experiment that uses computational
resources that are as dissimilar as smartphones and powerful laptops
or desktop computers in a research center. The methodology used to
gather resources and the algorithms used will be described next, as
well as the results obtained with the setup.

% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
