\begin{abstract}
Volunteer computing is used routinely in science and industry, but it
still has a long way to go if it is going to become mainstream in the
same way the cloud technologies in general have. The lack of general purpose tools
with analytics built in could be one of the reasons why this is so, as
well as the lack of proofs of concept. That is why in this paper we
present NodIO, a client-server architecture for distributed
evolutionary algorithms, written entirely in JavaScript, which needs
minimal server support to work and is able to support persistent,
asynchronous, distributed evolutionary algorithms running in the
browser. The architecture, along with some initial results on the expected performance and scaling
behavior is presented. We also use the algorithm analytics to try and  %[Pedro] I don't understand what "the algorithm analytics" stand for???
create a model of user behavior which, as is usual in this kind of
computing models, follow a Weibull distribution.

\section{Introduction}

\IEEEPARstart{N}{owadays}, there is a big and increasing number of
distributed evolutionary computation software frameworks available on
the market, usually as open source systems. Most of these systems have
two features: they are {\em desktop} applications, that is, they must
be compiled or run directly on the operating system layer and, second,
they assume that the nodes that are going to run the system are under
your control or at least you have access to them.

There is, then, space for systems that do not have any of those
assumptions, such as the one presented in this paper, which will be
provisionally named {\sf NodIO}. NodIO is first an application that
runs in two tiers, a server and a client that can be possibly run on a  % [Pedro] Both the server and the client in browsers? different browsers as I understand?
browser. As such, it can be run in any computer that loads the web
page where the client is embedded, including possibly many over which
the scientist has no control. 

When faced with the problem of diminishing funds for buying new     % [Pedro] This sentence is so so long. I would split it in two sentences.
hardware and continuous hardware failures of existing clusters and
taking into account our experience of working with web applications,
including JavaScript, from the beginning and other volunteer and
unconventional distributed evolutionary computing systems, our group
decided to create a new free framework that would allow anyone to
create a volunteer distributed EC experiment using cloud resources as
servers and browsers as clients. 

These systems must solve a series of issues before even starting to
measure performance; these issues are related to security as well as
safety, which introduces a {\em social} aspect to the design of a
computing system that makes it a {\em techno-social system}
\cite{vespignani2009predicting}. In this paper our intention is to
present the {\sf NodIO} framework and analyze it from two different
angles: the purely technical angle, including the decisions that went
into its features, and the social angle, to account on how the persons
that voluntarily choose to enter the web page that runs the system
determine its performance and how it can be modeled and, eventually,
predicted.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Next we present the
state of the art (Section \ref{sec:soa}) in web-based distributed 
computation systems along with attempts to predict and model its behavior. 
Then, a detailed description of the proposed system is presented 
in Section \ref{sec:description}, followed by the experiments and 
obtained results in Section \ref{sec:experiments}.
Finally, conclusions and future work are presented in Section \ref{sec:conclusion}.


%---------------------------------------------------------------
\section{State of the art}
\label{sec:soa}

The web used as a resource for distributed computing has a
long history, and almost since the beginning it was used for 
evolutionary computation even before JavaScript was
introduced as a browser-based scripting language in 1997. Before that
time other technologies,
%other technologies?
% changed - JJ
 including Flash animations and VBScript, ActiveX or Java applets were
used; for instance, Java was pointed out in \cite{soares1998get} as a ``language for
internet'', providing some advantages such as multi-architecture compatibility or 
security mechanisms and was proposed in \cite{chandy1996world} as the
basis for the creation of a world-wide peer to peer system using Java
compiled programs. The ATLAS system
\cite{Baldeschwieler:1996:TIG:504450.504482} also used Java together
with another language called Cilk; all these papers indicated that
the introduction of an architecture-independent system such as the
Java virtual machine opened the doors for ultrascale, Internet-wide,
metacomputers. This paper also establishes the desirable features of
any {\em global computing} infrastructure, that can also be applied to
distributed evolutionary computation experiments that rely on
volunteer computing: scalability, heterogeneity, fault tolerance,
adaptive parallelism, safety, anonymity, hierarchy, ease of use and
reasonable performance. Of all these, probably {\em hierarchy}, that
is, the capability of using preferentially resources in the same
organization could be either disregarded or included in adaptivity,
leaving us with eight desirable properties. 

Fulfilling these properties could be achieved using any of the
languages, and associated technologies, mentioned above, provided that the user had
installed the required virtual machine plugin first, but with the advantage of
providing a single and universal way of accessing resources via an
URI, something that is not guaranteed using desktop
applications. Baratloo et al. tried in 1996 to create a system with
the aforementioned qualities called {\em Charlotte}
\cite{baratloo1996charlotte}. This system, which implemented a
distributed shared memory, was inspired by previous work
on parallel computing systems PVM and MPI and solved most issues by
using the Java virtual machine embedded in the browser,
which provides
security to the user, uniformity of computing environment
independently of the operating system and access to a common data store in the
server. Since the virtual machine is a sandbox, it is safe to the user
and running a compiled bytecode guarantees a certain level of
performance. 
 Other issues such as scheduling, which are related to adaptive
 parallelism, are solved on the server. This 
paper was later extended and published in a journal in 1999
\cite{baratloo1999charlotte}, but it is interesting to note that
already in the early stages of the web the possibility of
browser-based distributed computing was already researched. 

Other systems, like JET, proposed by Soares et
al. \cite{soares1998get}, also used Java. JET supports 
the execution of parallel applications over the Internet and features
a comprehensive statistics collection subsystem, allowing its use for science,
since it allows the collection of algorithm analytics by the
experiment designer, unlike the other systems mentioned
above. Proposals contemporary to Jet, such as SuperWeb
\cite{alexandrov1997superweb} are roughly a translation of classical
distribution techniques, with complicated architectures that include
brokers for resource discovery. It is focused, however, in solving the
issues involved in browser-based computing and also in making a system
that is able to work across different classes of computers, mentioning
SPARCstations and Windows-95 computers. Interestingly enough, this
paper incorporates a discussion on the economic model, paving the way
for the for-profit distributed computing systems that later on
arose. On the other hand, the potential for volunteer computing using
browsers was realized 
later on \cite{sarmenta-bayanihan} as well as the potential for
mischief of users with code in their hands
\cite{sarmenta-sabotagetolerance}. However, these early efforts by
Sarmenta once again used Java and not JavaScript, making this effort
less universal.

The main problem with Java and all the other browser-embedded
technologies is that they are not {\em universal} in the
sense than an extra component, namely, the Java virtual machine, has
to be installed in the browser. JavaScript, however,
\cite{flanagan2006javascript} was introduced in 1997 as a
browser-embedded language and has, since then, become a set of standards
\cite{ECMA-262} that include the language and its components. Since
early on, it was adopted by the industry and also by scientists,
who used them for creating an EA on
the browser as early as 1998 \cite{jj-ppsn98}. 

JavaScript can be used either for unwitting
\cite{unwitting-ec} or volunteer
\cite{langdon:2005:metas,gecco07:workshop:dcor} distributed
evolutionary computation and it has been used ever since by several
authors, including more recent efforts \cite{Desell:2008:AHG:1389095.1389273,duda2013distributed,DBLP:journals/corr/abs-0801-1210} that even
used the client's GPU \cite{duda2013gpu}. Many other researchers have
used Java \cite{chong:1999:jDGPi} and others have gone away from the
server-based paradigm to embrace peer to peer systems
\cite{jin2006constructing,10.1109/ICICSE.2008.99}. These computing
platforms avoid single points of failure (the server) but, since they
need a certain amount of infrastructure installed to start, the
threshold to join them is much lower. 

Recent works propose the use of cloud computing services for the components of 
client-server distributed EAs. Cloud resources 
can reduce operational costs by outsourcing both hardware and software maintenance 
to the cloud provider. Another advantage is that they enable the provisioning of computing resources beyond what 
is available in most laboratories, allowing researches to 
scale algorithms at reasonable costs. Researchers have proposed the use of 
public clouds such as Amazon EC2 \cite{CloudScale}, Google App Engine\cite{di2013towards} 
and DropBox~\cite{mericloud}. The use of JavaScript to implement server side components, %FERGU: he puesto mejor el de revista en lugar del del CEC
gives software developers certain advantages in the cloud paradigm. JavaScript is a first-class citizen
in most Platforms as a Service (PaaS) as many support the Node.js framework 
\footnote{\url{https://strongloop.com/strongblog/a-comparison-of-node-js-paas-hosting-providers/}}. Also many web services %FERGU: he validado esta frase con un footnote, pero si quieres lo paso a referencias
have native JavaScript libraries and use JSON for data interchange. Another advantage is that 
developers can use the same software tools for both client and server side development. 
Besides the advantages to deal with the same language in the full stack as previously mentioned, 
this also facilitates the interoperability of the exchanged data types.
%Ayuda con la mini conclusion FERGU: mira la última frase de arriba

In the work presented in this paper, JavaScript was used in the full 
stack, which has the advantage of using the same code for writing
desktop or command line and browser clients, both based in the EC
library NodEO \cite{DBLP:conf/gecco/GuervosVGES14}. This saves time when writing code and leverages %FERGU: párrafo en pasado "was used" y presente "saves"
expertise acquired in the library itself. %FERGU: tienes info de LoC usadas para la sección experimental y justificar esta frase?
%The proposed software has the advantage of full stack JavaScript
%development..
%FERGU: añadido el siguiente párrafo y referencia para justificar el uso de JS
Javascript is also compatible with the functional programming paradigm. According to 
\cite{swanresearch2015}, the benefits of using this kind of paradigm in 
metaheuristics optimization allows an improvement in communicability, 
reproducibility, interoperability, automated assembly, knowledge engineering 
and efficiency. 

There have been relatively few efforts to analyze the
performance that can be obtained from these volunteer computing
efforts. 
%Too many efforts?
% No, too little - JJ 
% Digo efforts en la oración anterior :) - Mario
There were some initial attempts  to dodge the issue by making
the algorithm adaptive to the kind of resources allotted to it
\cite{milani2004online}, which is actually not such a big problem in
algorithms such as the EA that can easily be
parallelized via population splitting or farming out evaluations to all
the nodes available. Lately, several approaches have focused on the
fault-tolerance of volunteer algorithms
\cite{gonzalez2010characterizing} which can, of course, be studied in
a more general distributed computing context
\cite{nogueras2015studying} or including it in a more general study of the
performance of the EA itself
\cite{DBLP:journals/gpem/LaredoBGVAGF14}. 

%Mario: Estaba pensando que otra justificación muy fuerte para el uso de JS sobre plug-ins 
%ha sido la seguridad ya que estos presentan otra fuente de vulnerabilidad. Para complicar las cosas a veces (Flash, ActiveX) 
%son tecnologías cerradas y propietarias. Por lo menos creo que esas fueron las razones que se dieron para eliminar a Flash del iPhone.

As far as we know, this paper presents one of the few experiments that
uses computational 
%FERGU: yo no estaría tan seguro de esto
% Changed - JJ
resources that are as dissimilar as smartphones and powerful laptops
or desktop computers in a research center. The methodology used to
gather resources and the algorithms used will be described next, as
well as the results obtained with the setup.

%El último párrafo podría ser más preciso. Es el único experimento que utiliza recursos heterogeneos
%empleando las tecnologías estándar (JavaScript, JSON, Cookies, etc.) mencionadas previamente.

%Si no se extiende mucho se podría también hablar de la conexión con Cloud Computing,
%se discuten las ventajas de utilizar Javascript para acceder a recursos donados por voluntarios
%pero falta hablar de como se explotaría el recurso Cloud. Lo digo por el titulo de Volunteers in the Clouds. Tal vez
%se deba hablar de la posibilidad de escalar los sistemas a bajo costo
%o según la demanda.

% Si te animas, propón un párrafo - JJ
% Ok, lo escribo. - Mario
% Voy escribiendo algo de HTML5 y Web Workers?, no necesariemente para
% esta sección. 
% Para la intro o esta sección - JJ


%Algo novedoso es el uso de Javascript no solo en el cliente si no también en el Servidor.
%Como el tema es el Software creo que esto se tiene que resaltar. En los sistemas anteriores 
%se tenía lo de Java en el cliente, pero en el server estaba lo grueso del trabajo:
% Administrar el server - Ahora más fácil con cloud
% Programar el server side - Ahora se puede usar JavaScript también para eso. 
 
On the other hand, measuring performance of the resulting metacomputer
involves understanding the dynamics of this kind of systems. Initial
work was done for peer to peer systems by Stutzbach et
al. \cite{stutzbach2006understanding} and extended to volunteer
computing by Laredo et al. \cite{churn08,laredo2008rcp}. But the raw material of
volunteer computing, number of users and the time spent in the
computation in browser-based volunteer computing experiments, have only been studied in a limited way in
\cite{DBLP:journals/gpem/LaredoBGVAGF14} on the basis of a single
run. Studies using volunteer computing platforms such as SETI@home
\cite{javadi2009mining} found out that the Weibull, log-normal and Gamma distribution
modeled quite well the availability of resources in several clusters
of that framework; the shape of those distributions is a skewed bell
with more resources in the {\em low} areas than in the high areas:
there are many users that give a small amount of cycles, while there
are just a few that give many cycles. This is in concordance with the
results obtained in \cite{agajaj}. Our initial tests indicate that
this kind of distribution might be the most appropriate to describe
user participation in several different metrics. However, in this
paper we will perform different experiments in different setups and
will try to come up with a more precise model. Next we describe the
system itself.
