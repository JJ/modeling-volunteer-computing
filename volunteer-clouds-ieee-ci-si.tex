\begin{abstract}
Volunteer computing is used routinely in science and enterprise but it
still has a long way to go if it is going to become mainstream in the
same way the cloud in general has. The lack of general purpose tools
with analytics built in could be one of the reasons why this is so, as
well as the lack of proofs of concept. That is why in this paper we
present NodIO, a client-server architecture for distributed
evolutionary algorithms, written entirely in JavaScript, which needs
minimal server support to work and is able to support persistent,
asynchronous, distributed evolutionary algorithms running in the
browser. The architecture, along with some initial results on the expected performance and scaling
behaviour is presented. We also use the algorithm analytics to try and
create a model of user behavior which, as is usual in this kind of
computing models, follow a Weibull distribution.

\section{State of the art}
\label{sec:soa}

The web used as a resource for distributed computing has a
long history, and almost since the beginning it was used for 
evolutionary computation even before JavaScript was
introduced as a browser-based scripting language in 1997. Before that
time other procedures,
%other technologies?
 including Flash animations and VBScript, ActiveX or Java applets were
used; for instance, Java was pointed out in \cite{soares1998get} as a ``language for
internet'', providing some advantages such as multi-architecture compatibility or 
security mechanisms and was proposed in \cite{chandy1996world} as the
basis for the creation of a world-wide peer to peer system using Java
compiled programs. The ATLAS system
\cite{Baldeschwieler:1996:TIG:504450.504482} also used Java together
with another language called Cilk; all these papers indicated that
the introduction of an architecture-independent system such as the
Java virtual machine opened the doors for ultrascale, Internet-wide,
metacomputers. 

Using any of these languages allowed the creation
of client-server applications in the browser, provided that the user had
installed the required virtual machine plugin first, but with the advantage of
providing a single and universal way of accessing resources via an
URI, something that is not guaranteed using desktop applications. However, this style of
computing presents several issues and challenges which were addressed
as early as 1996 by Baratloo et al. in their system Charlotte:
\cite{baratloo1996charlotte}. This system, which implemented a
distributed shared memory, was inspired by previous work
on parallel computing systems PVM and MPI, but solved most issues by
using the Java virtual machine embedded in browser,
% by using the browser's embedded Java virtual machine,
which provides
security to the user, uniformity of computing environment
independently of the operating system and  access to a common data store in the
server. Other issues such as scheduling are solved on the server. This
paper was later extended and published in a journal in 1999
\cite{baratloo1999charlotte}, but it is interesting to note that
already in the early stages of the web the possibility of
%already in the early stages of the web, the possibility of
browser-based distributed computing was already researched. 

One of the first papers by Soares et al. used Java, and in their paper \cite{soares1998get} they
describe JET, a system that supports 
the execution of parallel applications over the Internet. This system has 
a comprehensive statistics support, allowing its use for science,
since it allows the collection of algorithm analytics by the
experiment designer, unlike the other systems compared in that
%experiment designer, unlike other systems compared in that
paper. Contemporary proposals, such as SuperWeb
\cite{alexandrov1997superweb} also propose a translation of classical
distribution techniques, with complicated architectures that include
brokers for resource discovery. It is focused, however, in solving the
issues involved in browser-based computing and also in making a system
that is able to work across different classes of computers, mentioning
SPARCstations and Windows-95 computers. Interestingly enough, this
paper incorporates a discussion on the economic model, paving the way
for the for-profit distributed computing systems that later on
arose. On the other hand, the potential for volunteer computing using
browsers was realized 
later on \cite{sarmenta-bayanihan} as well as the potential for
mischief of users with code in their hands
\cite{sarmenta-sabotagetolerance}. However, these early efforts by
Sarmenta once again used Java and not JavaScript, making this effort
less universal.

The main problem with Java and all the other browser-embedded
technologies is that they are not {\em universal} in the
sense than an extra component, namely, the Java virtual machine, has
to be installed in the browser. JavaScript, however,
\cite{flanagan2006javascript} was introduced in 1997 as a
browser-embedded language and has, since then, become a set of standards
\cite{ECMA-262} that include the language and its components. Since
early on it was adopted by the industry and also by scientists,
who used them for creating an EA on
the browser as early as 1998 \cite{jj-ppsn98}. 

JavaScript can be used either for unwitting
\cite{unwitting-ec} or volunteer
\cite{langdon:2005:metas,gecco07:workshop:dcor} distributed
evolutionary computation and it has been used ever since by several
authors, including more recent efforts \cite{Desell:2008:AHG:1389095.1389273,duda2013distributed,DBLP:journals/corr/abs-0801-1210} that even
used the client's GPU \cite{duda2013gpu}. Many other researchers have
used Java \cite{chong:1999:jDGPi} and others have gone away from the
server-based paradigm to embrace peer to peer systems
\cite{jin2006constructing,10.1109/ICICSE.2008.99}. These computing
platforms avoid single points of failure (the server) but, since they
need a certain amount of infrastructure installed to start, the
threshold to join them is much lower. 

There have been relatively few efforts to analyze what is the
performance that can be obtained from these volunteer computing
efforts. 
%Too many efforts?
There was some attempt initially to dodge the issue by making
the algorithm adaptive to the kind of resources allotted to it
\cite{milani2004online}, which is actually not such a big problem in
algorithms such as the EA that can easily be
parallelized via population splitting or farming out evaluations to all
the nodes available. Lately, several approaches have focused on the
fault-tolerance of volunteer algorithms
\cite{gonzalez2010characterizing} which can, of course, be studied in
a more general distributed computing context
\cite{nogueras2015studying} or including it in a more general study of
performance of the EA itself %Con tu permiso lo paso a acrÃ³nimos para
                             %que no sea tan largo el pÃ¡rrafo. FERGU
%OK - JJ
\cite{DBLP:journals/gpem/LaredoBGVAGF14}. But the raw material of
volunteer computing, number of users and the time spent in the
computation in browser-based volunteer computing experiments, have only been studied in a limited way in
\cite{DBLP:journals/gpem/LaredoBGVAGF14} on the basis of a single
run. Studies using volunteer computing platforms such as SETI@home
\cite{javadi2009mining} found out that the Weibull, log-normal and Gamma distribution
modeled quite well the availability of resources in several clusters
of that framework; the shape of those distributions is a skewed bell
with more resources in the {\em low} areas than in the high areas:
there are many users that give a small amount of cycles, while there
are just a few that give many cycles. This is in concordance with the
results obtained in \cite{agajaj}.

As far as we know, this paper presents the only experiment that uses computational
resources that are as dissimilar as smartphones and powerful laptops
or desktop computers in a research center. The methodology used to
gather resources and the algorithms used will be described next, as
well as the results obtained with the setup.

%El último párrafo podría se más preciso. Es el único experimento que utiliza recursos heterogeneos
%empleando las tecnologías estándar (JavaScript, JSON, Cookies, etc.) mencionadas previamente.

%Si no se extiende mucho se podría también hablar de la conexión con Cloud Computing,
%se discuten las ventajas de utilizar Javascript para acceder a recursos donados por voluntarios
%pero falta hablar de como se explotaría el recurso Cloud. Lo digo por el titulo de Volunteers in the Clouds. Tal vez
%se deba hablar de la posibilidad de escalar los sistemas a bajo costo o según la demanda.

%Algo novedoso es el uso de Javascript no solo en el cliente si no también en el Servidor.
%Como el tema es el Software creo que esto se tiene que resaltar. En los sistemas anteriores 
%se tenía lo de Java en el cliente, pero en el server estaba lo grueso del trabajo:
% Administrar el server - Ahora más fácil con cloud
% Programar el server side - Ahora se puede usar JavaScript también para eso.
